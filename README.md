VRM app layer

the repository  contains the set of documentation and executable to quickly create a regression run management flow with Questa Verification Run Manager.

If you want to be a contributor, which I encourage !, please make sure that you create your own branch and don't merge with master branch. I will be the integrator and will do the merge appropriately.
You can as well contribute by using the issues list to put your enhancement requests or support requests.

thanks !
